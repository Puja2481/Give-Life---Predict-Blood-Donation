# Give-Life-Predict-Blood-Donation
Blood transfusion saves lives - from replacing lost blood during major surgery or a serious injury to treating various illnesses and blood disorders. 

# About the Project
In this Project, I work with data collected from the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Center. The dataset, obtained from the Machine Learning Repository, consists of a random sample of 748 donors. My task was to predict if a blood donor will donate within a given time window
Our dataset is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. We want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus.
An accurate forecast for the future supply of blood allows for an appropriate action to be taken ahead of time and therefore saving more lives.
